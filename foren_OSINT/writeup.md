Through the hints in the description you have a list of 10 countries, in which you have to search.
A key point could be the fuel station but is a long research, for this reason you could use overpass-turbo (Open Street Map API) 
which allows a more detailed search by putting several key points found in the image as a value for a query.
Query Overpass Turbo:
```
(
  // query part for: “fuel”
  node["amenity"="fuel"]({{bbox}});
  way["amenity"="fuel"]({{bbox}});
  relation["amenity"="fuel"]({{bbox}});
)->.fuel;


(
  // query part for: “junction=roundabout”
  node["junction"="roundabout"]({{bbox}});
  way["junction"="roundabout"]({{bbox}});
  relation["junction"="roundabout"]({{bbox}});
)->.round;

node.fuel(around.round:100)->.fuelRoto;

(
  // query part for: “leisure=grass”
  node["landuse"="grass"]({{bbox}});
  way["landuse"="grass"]({{bbox}});
  relation["landuse"="grass"]({{bbox}});
)->.grass;

node.fuelRoto(around.grass:100)->.place;


(
  // query part for: “bridge”
  way["man_made"="bridge"]({{bbox}});
  relation["man_made"="bridge"]({{bbox}});
)->.bridge;

node.place(around.bridge:150);
```

You get a result between 0 and 2 points for each city, having to check a maximum of 10 possible results.
One of these is our flag.
