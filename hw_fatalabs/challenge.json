  "description": "Do you know? An innovative startup create a new type of ABS for the supercars.\n\nIt is revolutionary! It has the capacity to adapt to the condition of the road.\n\nSome rumors said this chip contains a fatal bug, but idk... can you analyze it for me? Here's the datasheet of the sensor and the VHDL file of the CPU.\n\n_Flag format:_ `srdnlen{[the value returned from sensor assuming there is 100% of humidity (16bits)]_[the line where the bug starts]}`\n\nAuthors: [@simonecocco](https://github.com/simonecocco)",
