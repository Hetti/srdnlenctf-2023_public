  "description": "My Sardinian grandmother was a great chef and pastry chef, when I went to visit her, she always delighted me with a typical recipe. Today I would like to try to replicate it and I asked her to send me the recipe, but besides being so weird and big I don\u2019t understand anything. Can you help me?\n\nAuthor: [@SalvaC\u00e0](https://github.com/SalvatoreCastello)",
