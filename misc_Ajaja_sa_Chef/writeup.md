The pdf is terribly large, it is therefore worth analyzing the structure and display the text in another file.

From the description of the challange you can notice two suggestions: the grandmother is Sardinian, the grandmother is a chef.

Looking at the file you can notice that it is divided into 2 main sections: "Ingredientes" and "Metodu", looking for any translator from Sardinian you can notice that they mean respectively "Ingredients" and "Method".

Searching on google information on a possible language with ingredients and method, the second suggestion leads us back to the esoteric language Chef.

By verifying the structure of the programming language and equipped with a translator you can understand the program instructions without the need to translate the whole program but only the first instruction and follow the same model for the other instructions, using a chef compiler with the desired structure, the flag will be output.

Another solution is not to use chef but to directly create a stack by hand or through a script and write the ingredients (which have a corresponding integer) letter by letter until you have the full flag.
