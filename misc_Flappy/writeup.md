Looking at the photo you can see two details:
- Both front people wear the same shirt with "Sharper european researchers night", together with the fact that the description refers to a "stand"By doing a quick google search you can easily find that it is a European event distributed in various cities of Europe.

- On the left we find a legible inscription on a billboard:
"edSP, evices and Signal Processing" this does not lead to any exhaustive results and you have to zoom in on the photo to notice an inscription "LA" just before the guy on the left, searching on google "evices and Signal Processing LA" this will help to autocomplete the search with the word "LAB", being a search event is in fact immediate reconnect the word LA- truncated to the word LAB.

The first research result shows MeDSP LAB, a laboratory within the University of Cagliari, the logo also coincides.

Looking on social media the MeDSP lab, in particular on X we immediately notice the post that leads back to their stand "Conosciamo i segnali del nostro corpo?" , searching on google this title of the stand is a result inside the site of Sharper-night where it is specified that the stand is located at Cagliari in Giardini Pubblici.
