  "description": "During the Cold War, HWLabs&Co. and SRDNLen were collaborating to develop a compact and fast RAM memory chip with many unique features. However, their efforts were not in vain, as one of their rivals had managed to steal a prototype of the chip 74LS6969 with an EEPROM of 8KB connected to it, along with a USB peripheral for connecting it to computers and an experimental datasheet that defined the mini circuit.\n\nThe flag format is `srdnlen{[FLAG]}`.",
