I was doing the presentation for the end of my first PhD Year and when I started writing my Acer laptop changed behavior... It was like possessed...!! Different windows opened and I could not find the presentation anymore. I captured the RAM but can you help me find what I wrote? This is a 4-levels challenge. LEVEL 1.
